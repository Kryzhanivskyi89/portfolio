- **Achievements in developments:**

  1. **Development of the main functionality of the CRM system:** Designed and implemented the key components of the Mriya-CRM CRM system, which included lists of employees, customers, services and goods. This significantly increased the efficiency of customer base management and automated business processes.
  2. **Development and optimisation of landing pages:** I have developed and optimised several landing pages, such as Portfolio, Web Studio, EcoSolution, and Cakes. In these projects, I provided responsive layout with Retina support, creating an attractive and user-friendly interface.
  3. Backend development: Successfully integrated with the Python and PostgreSQL backend in Mriya-CRM, as well as connected MongoDB and developed a Node.js backend for data processing in freelance projects, which ensured stable and uninterrupted operation of the systems.
  4. **Authorisation Implementation:** Fully developed and implemented a user authorisation system both on the front-end and server side, ensuring reliable data protection and secure access to systems.
  5. **Performance optimisation:** Used modern technologies such as React, Redux and RTK Query to ensure fast and stable operation of applications both in Mriya-CRM and freelance projects, which led to a decrease in page load time and increased system performance.
  6. Integration of special features:\*\* in the Cakes project, we added the functionality of sending emails via Nodemailer and a promotions timer, which increased user convenience and improved customer service.
  7. **Teamwork:** Effectively collaborated with other team members at BeautySync, as well as coordinated work on freelance projects, which allowed for successful project delivery on time.
  8. **Continuous improvement:** I worked on improving the Mriya-CRM system and introducing new features, and constantly developed my skills through freelance projects such as Phonebook, EcoSolution, So Yummy and others, which helped me to keep abreast of the latest technologies and approaches.
